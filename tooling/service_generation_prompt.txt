You are going to help me write some implementations of the following base class:

``` python
{% base_class_file %}
```

The class from this file I want to be implemented is {% base_class_name %}

the purpose of this class is {% class_purpose %}

This is an example implementation:

``` python
{% implementation_samples %}
```

Your response must encapsulate the code in a json structure exactly like the below example:

``` json
{% json_schema %}
```

You are not to respond with anything other than the json requested.

The service I want you to generate an implementation for is:

{% service_name %}

This services homepage is {% service_homepage %}

Ensure that the base classes are imported correctly based on the comments atop the file. They should be imported from services level, not greyhoundDashboard

You must also search for the logo of the service being referenced and supply the url in the response

all generated files should be prefix with service_
