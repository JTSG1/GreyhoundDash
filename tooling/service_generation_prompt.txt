You are going to help me write some implementations of the following base class:

``` python
{% base_class_file %}
```

The class from this file I want to be implemented is {% base_class_name %}

the purpose of this class is {% class_purpose %}

This is an example implementation:

``` python
{% implementation_samples %}
```

Your response must encapsulate the code in a json structure exactly like the below example:

``` json
{% json_schema %}
```

You are not to respond with anything other than the json requested.

The service I want you to generate an implementation for is:

{% service_name %}

This services homepage is {% service_homepage %}

Ensure that the base classes are imported correctly based on the comments atop the file. They should be imported from services level, not greyhoundDashboard

You must do deep research using the web search tool in order to determine if the app requested is a webapp.

The focus is on webapps, if the service queried is not a web app. respond with web_app = False othwerwise mark it as True

all generated files should be prefix with service_
